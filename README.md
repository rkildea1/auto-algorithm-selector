# auto-algorithm-selector
Auto-run several algorithms &amp; param's on the same problem and highlight best performers

It's easy enough to swap this out to test any other algorithms or parameters as you please.

SVM/
Random Forest/
Logistic Regression/
Decision Tree/
Bayes/
kNN


Below is what the results table might look like if you use my code
